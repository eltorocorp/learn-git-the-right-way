# Learn Git the Right Way

## Description
This is a collection of resources to help you learn Git in a way that will stick
in your head.

## The Problem
### Git essence is simple, Git usage is complex
Git is a software built upon a few key powerful concepts, that can be composed to
do everything conceivable under the sun. So on top of them, it has been built
one of the most extensive and complex command line user interfaces ever seen,
with a plethora of options to deal with every possible use case. This entails
that trying to learn Git by looking at how you use it is suicidal. You'll face
some non-standard task, give a wrong command and end up stuck in broken a
situation, with no clue on what to do next.


## The Solution
### Learn what Git is, not what Git does
The right way is starting to learn Git internal structure, those few key
concepts that make up Git. Namely the DAG, remotes and the three trees: working
directory, index and HEAD. This way even if you don't remember the details of
commands or face a non-standard task, you'll get your head around it and figure
a way to do what you want to do.
